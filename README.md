# Experiment work for SMGRAD

This repository is collection of my experiments to write my own gradient engine from scratch. We will call it `smgrad` (Different repo will contain code for smgrad where it would be in most optimized form without useless code snippets, that is the reason to create exteriment repo). I will be following tutorials of [Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy) here to get good idea about all mathematics behind neural networks and how it can be implemented in code.
<br><br>
This is not neural network from scratch stuff. This is about creating light weight alternative of tensorflow or pytorch.
<br><br>
I may create another repo for my work towards neural networks from scratch.
<br><br>
Note: My implementations for papers of deep learning maybe in different repos hence I am planning to make single repo with only README to contain links for all of those.
